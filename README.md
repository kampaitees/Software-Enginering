In this project I'm making an app in order to help farmer. Here we are providing the farmers, a platform in order to  sell their
crops without having a third person in between by direct contacting with the customer so that they may get the benefit of their
efforts.

                                        b. Sequence diagram
                                        c. Activity diagram
